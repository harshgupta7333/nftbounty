It is using React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useSelector/useDispatch from Redux.
It fetches configuration data from a config.json file to set things like the contract address, network details, max supply etc.
It connects to a blockchain (likely Ethereum) using web3 and displays the connected account.
It fetches and displays data like the total supply minted so far.
It has minting logic that allows minting 1 or more NFTs by sending a transaction to the smart contract.
It shows different UI elements based on minting state - like a loading state and success/error messages.
Styled components are used for UI elements like buttons.
React router is used for navigation.
Overall this looks like a fairly typical React dapp that integrates with web3 to connect to a blockchain and mint NFTs. Some key features are fetching on-chain data, minting logic, displaying minting status/messages, using Redux for state management and styled-components for UI styling.</p>
